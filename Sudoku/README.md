# Overview
Sudoku is a popular puzzle game consisting of a 9x9 grid (81 total individual grids), which is further divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The objective of the game is to fill each cell of the grid with a digit from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, each column, and each subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without any repetition.

### Backtracking
Backtracking is a method used to solve Sudoku by exploring all possible values for each cell in the grid until a solution is found. The algorithm starts by attempting to place a value in the first empty cell while ensuring it does not conflict with the rules of Sudoku. If a valid value is found, the algorithm moves to the next empty cell and repeats the process. However, if it encounters a cell where no value can be placed without breaking the rules, it backtracks by reverting to the previous cell (implemented by recursion), changing the value, and continuing from there. This process of trial and error continues recursively, correcting earlier mistakes until the puzzle is successfully solved.

### Metropolis
This is a method I learned in a course at Baruch College called "Introduction to Stochastic Processes." The Metropolis algorithm is generally slower than the Backtracking method. The algorithm begins by filling all the empty cells in the grid with random integer values from the range $[1, 9]$. Next, the energy of this filled puzzle is calculated, where the energy is determined based on the conflicts within the puzzle. A solved puzzle, with no conflicts, would have an energy level of 0. We then select a random cell in the grid, excluding clue cells, and assign it a new value that reduces the total energy of the puzzle, bringing it closer to being solved. This process is repeated until the puzzle's total energy reaches 0.
