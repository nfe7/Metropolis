# Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm Implementations in Python

This repository contains various implementations of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm

- **Sudoku Solver**  
  Used probabilistic sampling to generate valid Sudoku boards and progressively improve toward a solution using acceptance-rejection criteria

- **Portfolio Optimization**  
  Applied the algorithm to simulate optimal portfolio weight selection under different constraints
